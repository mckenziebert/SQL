#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as revenue

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity)
, product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum)

FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderid = customers.order_id

#8. Retrieve employee IDs (employee_ID)) that: 1. Start with ‘14’ 2. Have a single character after ‘14’ 3. End with ‘9’
SELECT employee_ID

#9. Find all orderIDs in the MarSales table from the BIT_DB database where the orderID has the characters ‘16’ in the beginning, followed by one unknown character, then a ‘0’, and any number of characters for the rest.
SELECT orderID

FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON Febsales.orderID = customers.order_id
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#12. Find order ids from Georgia (GA) where the order has an average price greater than $1,000. Only find orders from dates beginning with ‘04/1’.
SELECT AprSales.orderID
FROM BIT_DB.AprSales
WHERE AprSales.location LIKE '%GA%'
AND AprSales.orderdate LIKE '04/1%'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY orderID 
HAVING AVG(price) > 1000

#13. You’ve been given the results from the MaySales table. Reverse engineer a SQL query that returns these results.
SELECT MaySales.location
